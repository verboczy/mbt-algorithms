This repository deals with the topic of model-based testing, even more concretely test case generation.

As models are usually represented as graphs, it is possible to use (simple) graph travelling algorithms 
for generating test cases from models. I implemented a couple of these algorithms, a random one, another 
simple one, and Euler circle. Furthermore I learned about algorithms which can take a finite state machine 
from an unknown state to a known one, called synchronizing sequence and a similar one, called homing sequence.
